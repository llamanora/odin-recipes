    <p><h3>We all start somewhere!</h3></p>
    <p>This tastes as good as any restaurant or store-bought California roll.</p> 
    <p>Plus, it's one of the <em>easiest</em> sushi recipes for when you're first learning</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups sushi rice, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons black sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Bamboo sushi mat</li>
            <li>8 nori sheets</li>
            <li>1 small cucumber, seeded and julienned</li>
            <li>3 ounces imitation crabmeat sticks, julienned</li>
            <li>1 medium ripe avocado, peeled and julienned</li>
            <li>Optional: Reduced-sodium soy sauce, prepared wasabi and pickled ginger slices</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, combine rice and water; let stand for 30 minutes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove from the heat. Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Transfer rice to a large shallow bowl; drizzle with vinegar mixture. With a wooden paddle or spoon, stir rice with a slicing motion to cool slightly. Cover with a damp cloth to keep moist. (Rice mixture may be made up to 2 hours ahead and stored at room temperature, covered with a damp towel. Do not refrigerate.)</li>
            <li>Sprinkle toasted and black sesame seeds onto a plate; set aside. Place sushi mat on a work surface so mat rolls away from you; line with plastic wrap. Place 3/4 cup rice on plastic. With moistened fingers, press rice into an 8-in. square. Top with 1 nori sheet.</li>
            <li>Arrange a small amount of cucumber, crab and avocado about 1-1/2 in. from bottom edge of nori sheet. Roll up rice mixture over filling, using the bamboo mat to lift and compress the mixture while rolling; remove plastic wrap as you roll.</li>
            <li>Remove mat; roll sushi rolls in sesame seeds. Cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 8 rolls. Cut each into 8 pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi and ginger slices if desired.</li>
        </ol>
